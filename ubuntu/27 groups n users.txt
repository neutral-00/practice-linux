## users and groups
- All Linux users are assigned a unique user ID (uid) | normal users start with a uid of 1000 or greater
- Linux uses groups for organizing users.
- Groups are collections of accounts with certain shared permissions
- Access rights to files (and devices) are granted on the basis of
	- the user and
	- the group they belong to
- group membership is defined in the /etc/group file
- By default, every user belongs to a default (primary) group
- Users also have one or more group IDs (gid)
- The default gid is the same as the user ID
- These numbers are associated with names through the files /etc/passwd and /etc/group
- For example: 
	- /etc/passwd might contain john:x:1002:1002:John Garfield:/home/john:/bin/bash
	- /etc/group might contain john:x:1002
- To know the current user ui and group id type id with no arguments
- To know info for another user pass that username as argument.
	
## Adding and removing users
- Only the root user can add and remove users and groups
- use the useradd command to add a user
- use the userdel command to delete an existing user
$ sudo useradd student -m -c "Linux Student" -s /bin/bash
	- -m means create home directory
	- -c provide the full name
	- sets the home directory to /home/student
	- copies some basic files from /etc/skel to it | skel is skeleton
	- adds a line to /etc/passwd | student:x:1002:1002::/home/student:/bin/bash
	- confirm if a user folder is created under home: ls /home
	- set the password for the student account: $sudo passwd student | i kept: sxxxxxt
	- login to the new user type: ssh student@localhost
$ sudo userdel student
	- deletes the user but leaves the /home/student directory intact
	- use the -r option to delete the home directory as well while removing user
	
## adding and removing groups
- Adding a new group is done with groupadd
$ sudo /usr/sbin/groupadd anewgroup
- The group can be removed with:
$ sudo /usr/sbin/groupdel anewgroup
- first look at what groups the user already belongs to
$ groups student
- Adding a user to an already existing group is done with usermod
- warning: 
	- make sure to use -a to append, so as to avoid removing already existing groups
$ sudo /usr/sbin/usermod -a -G anewgroup student
- it will update /etc/group
- Removing a user from the group is somewhat trickier.

## identify the currents or login users
- To identify the current user, type whoami
- To list the currently logged-on users, type who OR who -a


## root account
- The root account is the super admin
- it has full access to the system
- it is often called the superuser account
- use sudo to assign more limited privileges to user accounts
	- Only on a temporary basis
	- Only for a specific subset of commands.

## switch user
- use the command su (switch or substitute user) to launch a new shell running as another user
- enter the password of the user bieng switch to
- The new shell allows the use of assigned privileges until it is exited.
- It is almost always a bad pratice to switch to root
- The preferred and less dangerouse is to use sudo.
- sudo must be enabled on a per-user basis
- user created during ubuntu installation is sudo enabled


## Elevating to root Account
- switch to root to temporarily become the superuser for a series of commands
- use sudo to execute just one command with root privilege.
- When the command is complete, you will return to being a normal unprivileged user.
- sudo configuration files are stored in the
	- /etc/sudoers.d/ directory and 
	- /etc/sudoers file
