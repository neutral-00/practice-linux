## install obs-studio
```sh
sudo apt-get install obs-studio
```

## while launching it I got graphics card error
Failed to initialize video. Your GPU may not be supported, or your graphics drivers may need to be updated.

- find out graphics card info:
```sh
lspci | grep VGA
```
I got:
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 4 Series Chipset Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 07)

- check with desktop environment currently you are using
```sh
echo $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP
```
I got:
GNOME

- find out the session type
```sh
echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
```
I got:
wayland


- to find out about open GL version, install mesa-utils
```sh
sudo apt-get install mesa-utils
```
- then run
```sh
glxinfo | grep "OpenGL version"
```
If your OpenGL version is lower than 3.3, you might need to update your Mesa drivers.

I got OpenGL version 2.1
Since OBS Studio requires at least OpenGL 3.3 and your current version is 2.1, 
luanch obs like below:
```sh
LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 obs
```
