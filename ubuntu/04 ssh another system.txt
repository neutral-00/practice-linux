you can use the ssh (Secure Shell) command to log in to another laptop

== Setting Up SSH Access
1. Install OpenSSH Server: On the remote laptop (the one you want to connect to), install the OpenSSH server if it's not already installed:
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

2. Start SSH Service
```sh
sudo systemctl start ssh
``` 

if you want to enable the SSH service to run at boot:
```sh
sudo systemctl enable ssh
```

3. Find the IP Address: Find the IP address of the remote laptop using the ifconfig or ip a command.

4. Connect via SSH: On your local laptop (the one youâ€™re connecting from), open the terminal and use the ssh command to connect:
```sh
ssh username@remote_ip_address
```
example:
ssh alice@192.168.1.2

Differences Between SSH and Graphical Remote Desktop
- SSH (Command Line):
- Use Case: Ideal for command-line tasks, file transfers, running scripts, and managing servers.
- Performance: Generally faster since it only transmits text data.
- Security: Encrypted connection, often considered more secure for administrative tasks.
- Simplicity: Lightweight and easy to set up with minimal configuration.

Graphical Remote Desktop:
- Use Case: Best for users who need to interact with the full desktop environment, access graphical applications, or provide remote technical support.
- Performance: Can be slower than SSH due to transmitting graphical data.
- Security: Also offers encrypted connections, but may require additional configuration for optimal security.
- User Interface: Provides a familiar graphical user interface for remote work.
