## Network Configuration Files
- Network configuration files are essential to ensure that interfaces function correctly.
- They are located in the /etc directory tree.
- For Debian family configurations, can be found under /etc/network/
- For Red Hat and SUSE family systems, can be found under /etc/sysconfig/network
- Modern systems emphasize the use of Network Manager
- Recent Ubuntu distributions include netplan, which is turned on by default
- and supplants Network Manager.


## Network Interfaces
- are a connection channel between a device and a network.
- can proceed through a network interface card (NIC
- or can be more abstractly implemented as software.
- Information about a particular network interface or all network interfaces can be reported by the ip and ifconfig utilities,
- ip is newer than ifconfig and has far more capabilities
- Some new Linux distributions do not install the older net-tools package
- to which ifconfig belongs, and so you would have to install it if you want to use it.


## ip
- VIEW IP ADDRESS
$ /sbin/ip addr show

- view routing info
$ /sbin/ip route show

## ping
- is used to check whether or not a machine attached to the network can receive and send data
- type ping <hostname>
- you can abort the execution of ping by typing CTRL-C, or by using the -c option
- some hosts refuse to answer ping requests.


## route
- Data moves from source to destination by passing through a series of routers and potentially across multiple networks.
- Servers maintain routing tables containing the addresses of each node in the network.
- The IP routing protocols enable routers to build up a forwarding table that correlates final destinations with the next hop addresses.
$ ip route
default via 172.19.64.1 dev eth0 proto kernel
172.19.64.0/20 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 172.19.71.42
- some commands that can be used to manage IP routing:
ip route		:		Show current routing table
ip route add	:		Add static route
ip route del	:		Delete static route


## traceroute
- is used to inspect the route which the data packet takes to reach the destination host
- By using traceroute, you can isolate connectivity issues between hops
- To print the route taken by the packet to reach the network host, at the command prompt, type traceroute <address>.

## More Networking Tools
ethtool			:		Queries network interfaces and can also set various parameters such as the speed
netstat			:		Displays all active connections and routing tables; useful for monitoring performance and troubleshooting
nmap			:		Scans open ports on a network; important for security analysi
tcpdump			:		Dumps network traffic for analysis
iptraf			:		Monitors network traffic in text mode
mtr				:		Combines functionality of ping and traceroute and gives a continuously updated display
dig				:		Tests DNS workings; a good replacement for host and nslookup

## lab
- restart the network and/or NetworkManager

student:/tmp> sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
student:/tmp> sudo systemctl restart network
student:/tmp> sudo service NetworkManager restart
student:/tmp> sudo service network restart

- If your device was up but had no IP address, the above should have helped fix it, but you can try to get a fresh address with
student:/tmp> sudo dhclient eth0
- substituting the right name for the Ethernet device.
- If your interface is up and running with an assigned IP address and you still cannot reach google.com,
- we should make sure you have a valid hostname assigned to your machine, with hostname:
student:/tmp> hostname
- see if the site is up and reachable with ping:
student:/tmp> sudo ping -c 3 google.com
- We have used -c 3 to limit to 3 packets; otherwise ping would run forever until forcibly terminated, say with CTRL-C 

- Note that there is another file, /etc/hosts, where you can associate names with IP addresses, 
- which is used before the DNS server is consulted. This is most useful for specifying nodes on your local network.

- Note, an enhanced version of traceroute is supplied by mtr, which runs continuously (like top). 
- Running it with the --report-cycles option to limit how long it runs:
student:/tmp> sudo mtr --report-cycles 3 8.8.8.8
