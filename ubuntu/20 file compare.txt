## Comparing Files with diff
- diff is used to compare files and directories
- see man diff for more details
- options
	-c : Provides a listing of differences that include three lines of context before and after the lines differing in content
	-r : Used to recursively compare subdirectories, as well as the current directory
	-i : Ignore the case of letters
	-w : Ignore differences in spaces and tabs (white space)
	-q : Be quiet: only report if files are different without listing the differences

- syntax: type diff [options] <filename1> <filename2>
- diff is meant to be used for text files; for binary files, one can use cmp
- If you prefer, there are multiple graphical interfaces to diff, including diffuse, vimdiff, and meld.
- You can compare three files at once using diff3, which uses one file as the reference basis for the other two.
- The syntax for diff3 is as follows:
$ diff3 MY-FILE COMMON-FILE YOUR-FILE
- A patch file contains the deltas (changes) required to update an older version of a file to the new one.
- The patch files are actually produced by running diff with the correct options, as in:
- $ diff -Nur originalfile newfile > patchfile
- To apply a patch, you can just do either of the two methods below:
$ patch -p1 < patchfile
$ patch originalfile patchfile
- see the man page for patch.
