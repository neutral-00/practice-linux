## backup
- Basic ways to backup includes:
	- simple copying with cp
	- and use of the more robust rsync
- rsync is more efficient, because it checks if the file being copied already exists.
- Furthermore, because rsync copies only the parts of files that have actually changed
- cp can only copy files to and from destinations on the local machine
- but rsync can also be used to copy files from one machine to another


## rsync
- back up a project directory might be to use the following command:
$ rsync -r project-X archive-machine:archives/project-X
- It is highly recommended that you first test your rsync command using the -dry-run option
- to ensure that it provides the results that you want
- A good combination of options is shown in:
$ rsync --progress -avrxH  --delete sourcedir destdir
