## file
- In Linux, a file's extension does not, by default, categorize its nature the way it might in other operating systems.
- The real nature of a file can be ascertained by using the file utility.
- For the file names given as arguments, it examines the contents and certain characteristics to determine 
- whether the files are plain text, shared libraries, executable programs, scripts, or something else

For this exercise, you could use any text file, but we will use /etc/group as described.
