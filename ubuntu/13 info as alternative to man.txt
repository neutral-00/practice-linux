## about info
- another alternative source of documentation is info
- try: info ls

- info command without any arguments will displays an index of available topics. 
You can browse through the topic list using the regular movement keys: arrows, Page Up, and Page Down.

Some useful keys are: q to quit, h for help, and Enter to select a menu item.

The topic which you view in an info page is called a node. The table lists the basic keystrokes for moving between nodes.
Nodes are essentially sections and subsections in the documentation

key		function
n		Go to the next node
p		Go to the previous node
u		Move one node up in the index
q		quit info

## conventions
- Items function like browser links and are identified by an asterisk (*) at the beginning of the item name.
- Named items (outside a menu) are identified with double-colons (::) at the end of the item name.
