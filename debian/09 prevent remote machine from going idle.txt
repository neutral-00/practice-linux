== conclusion : nosuspend.conf works, check the last portion of this file
- tried caffein but didn't work out well

```sh
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 0
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-ac-type 'nothing'
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-battery-type 'nothing'
```

in case you want to revert to default
```sh
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 300
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-ac-type 'suspend'
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-battery-type 'suspend'
```

- alternate approach | you disable these settings temporarily then try out caffeine
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install caffeine
# caffeine requires PyObject, install it
sudo apt install libcairo2-dev gobject-introspection
pip3 install pycairo
pip3 install pygobject

caffeine &
# to stop run the below command
pkill caffeine
```
The caffeine tool will temporarily disable the screen saver and power saving features while it's running.
The remote machine screen may go blank/black. That's ok. but the machine will not go idle if caffeine is running.
- to check if caffeine is running run the below command
```sh
ps aux | grep caffein
```

To keep caffeine running even after logout run it as
```sh
export DISPLAY=:0
nohup caffeine &
```

## even though caffeine was running in the background with even nohup, my session got disconnected.
## so create a config and restart systemctl daemon
```sh
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/sleep.conf.d
sudo nvim /etc/systemd/sleep.conf.d/nosuspend.conf
```
- add the below contents:
[Sleep]
AllowSuspend=no
AllowHibernation=no
AllowSuspendThenHibernate=no
AllowHybridSleep=no

- Save and exit the editor with :wq
- Restart the systemd service
```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind
```
