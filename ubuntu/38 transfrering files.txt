## FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
- File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a well-known and popular method for transferring files between computers using the Internet. 
- FTP can be used within a browser or with stand-alone client programs
- FTP is one of the oldest methods of network data transfer, dating back to the early 1970s.
- it is considered inadequate for modern needs, as well as being intrinsically insecure.


## FTP Clients
- FTP clients enable you to transfer files with remote computers using the FTP protocol.
- These clients can be either graphical or command line tools.
- Filezilla, for example, allows the use of the drag-and-drop approach to transfer files between hosts.
- All web browsers support FTP; all you have to do is give a URL like ftp://ftp.kernel.org where the usual http:// becomes ftp://.
- Some command line FTP clients are:
	- ftp
	- sftp
	- ncftp
	- yafc
- passwords are user credentials that can be transmitted without encryption and are thus prone to interception.
- Thus, it was removed in favor of using rsync and web browser https access.
- As an alternative, sftp is a very secure mode of connection, which uses the Secure Shell (ssh) protocol.
- sftp encrypts its data and thus sensitive information is transmitted more securely. 
- However, it does not work with so-called anonymous FTP (guest user credentials).


## SSH: Executing Commands Remotely
- Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure data communication.
- It is also used for remote services and other secure services between devices on the network
- is very useful for administering systems with remote access.
- To login to a remote system using your same user name you can just type ssh some_system and press Enter.
- ssh then prompts you for the remote password.
- You can also configure ssh to securely allow your remote access without typing a password each time.
- If you want to run as another user, you can do either ssh -l someone some_system or ssh someone@some_system. 
- To run a command on a remote system via SSH, at the command prompt, you can type ssh some_system my_command.


## Copying Files Securely with scp
- We can also move files securely using Secure Copy (scp) between two networked hosts.
- scp uses the SSH protocol for transferring data.
- To copy a local file to a remote system, at the command prompt, type
scp <localfile> <user@remotesystem>:/home/user/ and press Enter.
- You will receive a prompt for the remote password.
- You can also configure scp so that it does not prompt for a password for each transfer.
