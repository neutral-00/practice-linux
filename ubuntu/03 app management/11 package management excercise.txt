## see list of installed packages
$ dpkg --list


## check if git is already installed
$ dpkg -l | grep git
OR
$ which git
returns the path of git if installed

$ whereis git
- returns git as well as git manual paths


## install the cowsay packages
$ sudo apt-get install cowsay
You might get:
E: Unable to locate package cowsay
try updating your repository and run the install again
$ sudo apt update
To check if a package is available in the repository, you can use the following command:
$ apt-cache search <package-name>
Alternatively, you can use the following command to check if a package is available in the repository:
$ apt-cache policy <package-name>
This command will display the details of the package, including the version number and the repository it is available in. 
If the package is not available in the repository, the command will return nothing.


Once the installation is complete, you can use the cowsay command to generate ASCII art of a cow with a message.
try out
$ cowsay "hello"
$ cowsay -l
$ cowsay -f dragon "hello"


## check how much disk space is used by a package
$ dpkg-query -s <package-name> | grep Installed-Size
- this will return the size in kilobytes
OR alternatively, you can use the apt-cache command to check the disk space used by a package.
$ apt-cache show <package-name> | grep Installed-Size
- i think dpkg-query is more stable because when i tried for git, it gave me single value  where as apt-cache gave me 3 values

## see the list of upgradable packages
Run 'apt list --upgradable' to see them.

## upgrade
To update all the upgradable packages in Linux, you can use the following command:
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
This command will update the package list and then upgrade all the installed packages to their latest versions. 
If any new packages are available, they will also be installed.

## check if any new version is available for a specific package
$ apt list <packageName>
or
$ apt-cache policy <packageName>

## install latest version of a specific package
$ sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade <packagename>


Alternatively, you can use the following command to upgrade all the upgradable packages:
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
This command will perform a distribution upgrade and upgrade all the installed packages to their latest versions. 
It will also remove any obsolete packages and install any new packages that are required 

## info on distribution update
A distribution upgrade is a process of upgrading the entire operating system to a new version. 
It involves upgrading all the installed packages, including the kernel, libraries, and applications, to their latest versions.

The dist-upgrade command is used to perform a distribution upgrade in Debian-based systems such as Ubuntu. 
It is similar to the upgrade command, but it can also remove packages that are no longer needed and 
install new packages that are required to resolve dependencies.

The dist-upgrade command is more aggressive than the upgrade command and can potentially break the system if not used carefully. 
It is recommended to take a backup of important data before performing a distribution upgrade.


## uninstall package
To uninstall a package in Linux, you can use the following command:
$ sudo apt-get remove <package-name>
Replace <package-name> with the name of the package you want to uninstall. 
This command will remove the package from your system, 
but it will not remove any configuration files associated with the package

If you want to remove the package and its configuration files, you can use the following command:
$ sudo apt-get purge <package-name>
This command will remove the package and its configuration files from your system.

$ sudo apt-get purge cowsay
