== conclusion : tried and uninstalled
- have tried out
- but looks like it requires some sandbox id and didn't figure out how to setup one.
- can run with the flag --no-sandbox
- but running that way doesn't feel secure
- tried visiting youtube, the images and videos were pixelated, not really a good experience
- so uninstalled
