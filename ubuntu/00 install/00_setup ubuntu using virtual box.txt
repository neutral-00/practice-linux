### Install Virtualbox In Windows 11
<section>
- google virtualbox OR click on the link: https://www.virtualbox.org/
- Click on: Download Virtual Box 7
- Click on windows host link and download will be initiated
- Once downloaded, click on the exe file and proceed as per the installation wizard
- you might get a popup saying:
Oracle VM VirtualBox 7.0.14 needs Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Redistributable Package being installed first.
Please install and restart the installation of Oracle VM VirtualBox 7.0.14

- follow the [install Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Redistributable Package] steps below and come back
- I updated the installation location to : D:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox
- click next
- There will be warning related to Network Interface, click Next
- I also got another warning on Missing dependencies Python Core / win32api
The win32api module is used to interact with the Windows system and 
is required for advanced features such as handling virtual machines with commands and using things from your computer in your virtual machines 

- Installing the Python Core/win32api module will give you all the virtualization powers of VirtualBox.
- refer the [install Python Core/win32api] below
</section>


### Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Redistributable Package
<section>
- checkout this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKTKgjUHu48
- Google Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Redistributable Package
- click on first link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170
- Click on [Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022]
- Click on link for the x64
- Once downloaded install it.
- restart your pc, and start virtualbox installation again.
- Follow the instructions and complete the installation for VirtualBox.
</section>


### Install Python Core/win32api
<section>
- refer [How to Fix Missing Dependencies Python Core / win32api in VirtualBox](https://www.sysnettechsolutions.com/en/fix-python-win32api-virtualbox/)
- download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
- For me the installation location is D:\Program Files\Python\Python312
- Now, open PowerShell/CMD as admin, and type “py -m pip install pywin32” to install pywin32.
- If you see a new Pip update, run the command below to update it quickly
python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
- run the pip install for pywin32 again:
$ py -m pip install pywin32
Requirement already satisfied: pywin32 in d:\program files\python\python312\lib\site-packages (306)

### Create a Virtual Machine With Ubuntu as the OS
<section>
- refer this blog: https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview
- visit https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop
- download the ISO by clicking on [Download 22.04.3](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?version=22.04.3&architecture=amd64)
- run VirtualBox
- *Create a new virtual machine*
	- Click Machine>New
	- Fill the details
		- name: ubuntu
		- folder: D:\Program Data\VirtualBox VMs
		- ISO image: C:\Users\toarv\Downloads\ubuntu-22.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso
	- click Next
	- change the username and password to create user without sudo access.
		- username: linuxuser00
		- password: Lxxxxxx_00
		- hostname: ubuntu
		- domainname: myguest.virtualbox.org
		- guest additions | checked
		- install in background | leave unchecked
	- if you use default, user will be created without sudo access.
	- click Next
	- Virtual Machine’s resources
		- For good performance it’s recommended to provide your VM with around 8GB of RAM (althought 4GB will still be usable) and 4 CPUs
		- Try to remain in the green areas of each slider to prevent issues with your machine
		- base memory: 8192
		- processors: 8
	- click Next
	- Set the virtual harddisk.
		- For Ubuntu recommended around 25 GB as a minimum.
		- I have given 50 GB
		- By default the hard disk will scale dynamically as more memory is required up to the defined limit.
	- Click Next
	- Review the details
		- host/domain name is: ubuntu.myguest.virtualbox.org
	- Click Finish
	- Install Image
		- Click Start to launch the virtual machine.
		- You will see a message saying ‘Powering VM up …’ and your desktop window will appear
		- On first boot the unattended installation will kick in so do not interact with the prompt
		- let it progress automatically to the splash screen and into the installer
		- If you chose not to use unattended install then you will need to progress through the Ubuntu install manually.
			- you checkout the installation guide here: https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#4-boot-from-usb-flash-drive
		- You will notice at this stage that the resolution of the window is fixed at 800x600. 
		- This is because the Guest Additions features are not installed until after the Ubuntu installation has completed.
		- Once the installation completes, the machine will automatically reboot to complete the installation.
		- Finally you will be greeted with the Ubuntu log-in screen where you can enter your username and password defined during the initial setup
	- Enjoy your shiny new Ubuntu Desktop!

### Add User To Sudoers List
<section>
- somehow I missed to add the user to sudoers list
- https://askubuntu.com/questions/1440032/virtualbox-ubuntu-22-04-how-to-add-sudo-rights
$ su -
$ password: {enter the same password entered during virtual machine creation: Lxxxxxx_00}
$ usermod -a -G sudo linuxuser00
- Then log out and back in for changes to take effect.
</section>


### Recommended
<section>
- open a terminal and run the following commands to get everything updated:
 `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo snap refresh`
</section>


### Shuting Down VM	
<section>
- Once you’ve finished your session you can close your machine by clicking the X in the top right of the window and 
- choosing whether to keep your machine frozen in its current state or shut it down completely.
