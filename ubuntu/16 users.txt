## users
- multiple users can access a system simultaneously
- each user can run multiple processes
- Real User ID (RUID): operating system assigns each user a ruid
	- ruid is used to identify who started a process.
- Effective UID (EUID): The user who determines the access rights for the users is identified by the euid.
	- euid determines the access rights of the user
- ruid and euid may or may not be the same.

- rgid is the group identifer.
- egid determines the access rights of the group.
