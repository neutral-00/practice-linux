## startup files
- In Linux, the command shell program (generally bash) uses one or more startup files to configure the user environment.
- Global settings are defined in [/etc]
- initialization files in the user's home directory can override global settings
- The startup files can do anything the user would like to do in every command shell, such as:
	- Customizing the prompt
	- Defining command line shortcuts and aliases
	- Setting the default text editor
	- Setting the path for where to find executable programs

	
## Order of the Startup Files
- when user is login /etc/profile is read and evaluated first
- then the following files are searched in the listed order
	- 1. ~/.bash_profile
	- 2. ~/.bash_login
	- 3. ~/.profile 
- ~/ denotes the user's home directory
- whatever startup file that it comes across first is evaluated and ignores the rest.
- every time you create a new shell, ~/.bashrc file is read and evaluated. 
- most distributions and/or users include the ~/.bashrc file from within one of the three user-owned startup files
- Most commonly, users only fiddle with ~/.bashrc
