## Creating Aliases
- create aliases to customized commands or modify the behavior of already existing ones
- placed aliases in your ~/.bashrc (think why)
- to an alias use the command: unalias
- example:
$ alias la='ls -A'
- Warning:
	- there should not be any spaces on either side of the equal sign
	- keep the alias definition within either single or double quotes if it contains any spaces


## use case
- suppose you are working on a group project.
- you need to create/modify files in /home/staff/RandD/projects/projectX/src
- create an alias say projx to cd into this path
$ vim ~/.bashrc
- add the below entry
alias projx='cd /home/staff/RandD/projects/projectX/src'
- lanch a new terminal and type
$ projx
