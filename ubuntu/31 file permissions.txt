## File ownership
- every file is associated with a user who is the owner
- Every file is also associated with a group 
- commands and usage
chown	:	Used to change user ownership of a file or directory
chgrp	:	Used to change group ownership
chmod	:	Used to change the permissions on the file


## File permissions
- Files have three kinds of permissions: read (r), write (w), execute (x).
- There are three groups of owners: user/owner (u), group (g), and others (o).
rwx: rwx: rwx
 u:   g:   o
- a single digit suffices to specify all three permission bits for each entity
	- 4 if read permission is desired
	- 2 if write permission is desired
	- 1 if execute permission is desired

- Thus, 
	- 7 means read/write/execute
	- 6 means read/write
	- 5 means read/execute
- So you can do:
$ chmod 755 somefile
