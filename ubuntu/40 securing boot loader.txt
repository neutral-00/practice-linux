- You can secure the boot process with a secure password to prevent someone from bypassing the user authentication step
- This can work in conjunction with password protection for the BIOS.
- Note that while using a bootloader password alone will stop a user from editing the bootloader configuration during the boot process,
- it will not prevent a user from booting from an alternative boot media such as optical disks or pen drives
- Thus, it should be used with a BIOS password for full protection.
- For the older GRUB 1 boot method, it was relatively easy to set a password for grub. 
- However, for the GRUB 2 version, things became more complicated.
- However, you have more flexibility, and can take advantage of more advanced features, such as user-specific passwords
- Furthermore, you never edit grub.cfg directly
- instead, you can modify the configuration files in /etc/grub.d and /etc/defaults/grub, 
- and then run update-grub, or grub2-mkconfig and save the new configuration file.
