## Learning Objective
- basic networking concepts
- Configure network interfaces using ifconfig, ip, ping, route and traceroute.
- Use graphical and non-graphical browsers, such as Lynx, w3m, Firefox, Chrome and Epiphany.
- Transfer files to and from clients and servers using both graphical and text mode applications, such as scp, ftp, sftp, curl and wget.

## basic concepts
- The computers connected over a network are called nodes.
- Networking is used to
	- share music and video servers, printers, and scanners
	- Share and manage information such as databases and file systems across computers
- The Internet is the largest network in the world.
- Devices attached to a network must have at least one unique network address identifier known as the IP.
- Exchanging information across the network requires using streams of small packets
- These packets contain data buffers, together with headers which contain information about
	- where the packet is going to
	- and coming from
	- and where it fits in the sequence of packets that constitute the stream.
	
### IPv4 and IPv6
- These are two different types of IP versions. 	
- IPv4 is older and by far the more widely used
- IPv6 is newer and is designed to get past limitations inherent in the older standard
- IPv4 uses 32-bits for addresses thus 4.3 billion unique addresses available.
- IPv6 uses 128-bits for addresses thus 3.4 X 1038 unique addresses
- warning:
	- moving equipment and addresses to IPv6 requires significant effort.
- One reason IPv4 has not disappeared is because 
	- there are widely-used ways to effectively make many more addresses available by methods such as NAT (Network Address Translation).
- NAT:
	- NAT enables sharing one IP address among many locally connected computers
	- each of which has a unique address only seen on the local network.
	- For example, if you have a router hooked up to your Internet Provider 
	- it gives you one externally visible address,
	- but issues each device in your home an individual local address, which is invisible to the outside world.
	
### Decoding IPv4 Addresses
- A 32-bit IPv4 address is divided into four 8-bit sections called octets
- Example:
IP address →            172  .          16  .          31  .         46
Bit format →     10101100.00010000.00011111.00101110
- Network addresses are divided into five classes: A, B, C, D and E
- Classes A, B and C are classified into two parts:
	- Network addresses (Net ID): used to identify the network
	- Host address (Host ID): used to identify a host in the network
- Class D is used for special multicast applications
	- information is broadcast to multiple computers simultaneously
- Class E is reserved for future use

#### Class A
- The first bit of the first octet is always set to zero. So you can use only 7-bits for unique network numbers.
- As a result, there are a maximum of 126 Class A networks available
- As the use of the Internet expanded, Classes B and C were added in order to accommodate the growing demand for independent networks.
- Each Class A network can have up to 16.7 million unique hosts on its network
- The range of host addresses is from 1.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255.
- The value of an octet can range from 0 to 255


#### Class B
- uses the first two octets of the IP address as their Net ID and the last two octets as the Host ID.
- The first two bits of the first octet are always set to binary 10
- so there are a maximum of 16,384 (14-bits) Class B networks.
- The first octet of a Class B address has values from 128 to 191
- Each Class B network can support a maximum of 65,536 unique hosts on its network.
- The range of host addresses is from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255


#### Class C
- use the first three octets of the IP address as their Net ID and the last octet as their Host ID
- The first three bits of the first octet are set to binary 110.
- so almost 2.1 million (21-bits) Class C networks are available
- The first octet of a Class C address has values from 192 to 223
- These are most common for smaller networks which don't have many unique hosts.
- Each Class C network can support up to 256 (8-bits) unique hosts
- The range of host addresses is from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
	

## IP Address Allocation
- Typically, a range of IP addresses are requested from your Internet Service Provider (ISP) by your organization's network administrator.
- Often, your choice of which class of IP address you are given depends on 
	- the size of your network and
	- expected growth needs
- If NAT is in operation, such as in a home network, you only get one externally visible address!
- You can assign IP addresses to computers over a network either manually or dynamically. 
- Manual assignment adds static (never changing) addresses to the network. 
- Dynamically assigned addresses can change every time you reboot
	- or even more often; the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is used to assign IP addresses.

## Name Resolution
- Name Resolution is used to convert numerical IP address values into a human-readable format known as the hostname
- For example, 3.13.31.214 is the numerical IP address that refers to the hostname linuxfoundation.org
- Given an IP address, you can obtain its corresponding hostname.
- You can view your system’s hostname simply by typing hostname with no argument.
- The special hostname localhost is associated with the IP address 127.0.0.1 and describes the machine you are currently on.


## important files and commands to lookout for
$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
# This file was automatically generated by WSL. To stop automatic generation of this file, add the following entry to /etc/wsl.conf:
# [network]
# generateResolvConf = false
nameserver 172.19.64.1

$ cat /etc/hosts
# This file was automatically generated by WSL. To stop automatic generation of this file, add the following entry to /etc/wsl.conf:
# [network]
# generateHosts = false
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       Neutral00.      Neutral00

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
